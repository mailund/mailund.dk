      <title>Slides for Computational Thinking (Chapter 3)</title>

      <description>I’m teaching four weeks of a class called Computational Thinking in Bioinformatics this year (the other weeks are taught by colleagues).
It is this class that got me started on my book Introduction to Computational Thinking. I have finished the chapters I need for the class—chapters three, four, five, seven and nine—but there is still a looong way to go before the book is done.
Anyway, I am not writing on the book these days, but make slides for the lectures. That takes surprisingly long time. I have grown used to having slides to pick and choose from for any lecture, but I am starting from scratch here.</description>

      <title>Premarkdown Plugins</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m working on a preprocessor for Markdown documents. I write all my books in Markdown, so this is something I have wanted to do for a while, to scratch a few itches I have.
I write my books in Markdown and then I process them using Pandoc. If you are not familiar with that setup, then I have written a short book on the topic: The Beginner&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Markdown and Pandoc.
For that book, because it is very short, I just have a single Markdown document containing the entire book, but usually, I have one file per chapter. Pandoc doesn&amp;rsquo;t handle that, but you can cat the files before you convert the Markdown source to PDF or ePUB documents.</description>

      <title>New Books Page</title>

      <description>I have set up a page for the books I have written. Nothing fancy there, it is just a list together with the cover text, but it does collect all my books on one single page.
I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of putting one sample chapter per book here. I need to check with my Apress contracts, but I believe I can do this as long as it is less than 10%.</description>

      <description>I enjoy writing and I&amp;rsquo;ve written bunch of books by now. Mostly about R programming, but also on a few other topics.
When I&amp;rsquo;m working on a book I haven&amp;rsquo;t sold yet, I usually put the draft on Leanpub where you can get it for free until it is done. Once I&amp;rsquo;ve sold a book, I have to pull it from Leanpub, but it is a good way to get an early copy, and a good way for me to get feedback while writing. If you get a draft there, then please let me know what you think and how I can improve it.</description>
