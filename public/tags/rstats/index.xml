      <description>In my previous post I used the lm function for an example of scope rules, but I left a few details out. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to muddy the example with too many details, so I choice to lie a little.
The drawing I used to explain the example was this:
  I explained how scope is implemented using environments that are chained through parent pointers, and how a function has an environment associated with it. This environment is the environment where you define the function.
When you call a function, it gets its own instance environment (for historical reasons more than anything else we call this the call frame, but it is really just a new environment).</description>

      <description>Earlier this week, I wrote some tweets about how you have to be careful about scopes when you do non-standard evaluation. I cover this in both Metaprogramming in R and Domain-Specific Languages in R, but this tweet
Comprehensive overview of NSE. Should be of interest to @ThomasMailund @MilesMcBain @_ColinFay and @edwin_thoen https://t.co/2uI1HSnfEN
&amp;mdash; Deemah ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡´ (@dmi3k) September 17, 2018  made me write about it againâ€”only this time in a twitter thread.
Well, I say threadâ€”I don&amp;rsquo;t actually know how to do that, it seams; I just replied to the tweet a bunch of times and apparently that doesn&amp;rsquo;t make a thread, it therefore my reply was hard to read.</description>
