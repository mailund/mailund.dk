      <description>I enjoy writing and I&amp;rsquo;ve written bunch of books by now. Mostly about R programming, but also on a few other topics.
When I&amp;rsquo;m working on a book I haven&amp;rsquo;t sold yet, I usually put the draft on Leanpub where you can get it for free until it is done.</description>

      <title>Book update: Pointers in C and and Computational Thinking</title>

      <description>So, my C pointers book apparently has a cover now. Before you complain, I don&amp;rsquo;t write the titles (although I don&amp;rsquo;t disagree with the title for this book), nor the subtitles (where I do for this one).</description>

      <title>OOP example in C</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m writing the chapter on function pointers in my C pointers book, and I want a nice example of how you can use them to implement rudimentary object-oriented programming with dynamic dispatch.</description>

      <title>Reference counting lists in C</title>

      <description>I was playing with reference counting garbage collection last week, for something I want to add to my C pointers book. That chapter is still far in the future, and moving further into the future as the book seems to grow in front of me, but one day I will get to it.</description>

      <description>I forgot to post about it when The Joys of Hashing came out, but it is never too late to blow my own horn. It is out and you should get it.</description>

      <title>Elegant Scipy</title>
      <link>https://mailund.dk/posts/elegant-scipy/</link>

      <guid>https://mailund.dk/posts/elegant-scipy/</guid>
      <description>I was a little disappointed about this. I had hoped it would give a good overview of Scipy, but instead, it is a bunch of examples that use it. It is not that the examples aren&amp;rsquo;t interesting.</description>

      <description>I also finished Seeing Further: The Story of Science, Discovery, and the Genius of the Royal Society yesterday. I found this a mixed back. When I bought it I thought it was a Bill Bryson book—I like those—but if I had checked the description just a little bit I would have seen that it is only edited by Bryson.</description>

      <description>In the weekend I finished The Power of Habit.
This is a very interesting book. Duhigg writes about how we are run by habit to a degree I had not imagined.</description>

      <description>To my utter shock, it turns out that I am not perfect. There are mistakes in my books!
A couple of readers made me aware of a typo in Functional Programming in R.</description>

      <description>Chapter 2 The Structure of a Recursive Function, page 32: &amp;ldquo;Here I am assuming that is an integer…&amp;rdquo; should be &amp;ldquo;Here I am assuming that n is an integer…&amp;rdquo;
Chapter 3 Nested Functions and Scopes, page 53ff.</description>

      <description>If you are a member of Audible—and if you like audiobooks I think you should be—then they now give you two of six selected books for free every month. They call this Audible Originals, and while you only get six books to choose from, I am not complaining about getting something for free.</description>

      <title>Fluent Python</title>
      <link>https://mailund.dk/posts/fluent-python/</link>

      <guid>https://mailund.dk/posts/fluent-python/</guid>
      <description>I just finished reading Fluent Python. This is a really nice book on Python programming. It is not an introduction to Python programming, and it is not about specific packages, such as SciPy or Scikit-learn.</description>

      <guid>https://mailund.dk/posts/new-books-page/</guid>
      <description>I have set up a page for the books I have written. Nothing fancy there, it is just a list together with the cover text, but it does collect all my books on one single page.</description>

      <title>Errata: Functional Data-Structures in R</title>
      <link>https://mailund.dk/errata/fdsinr/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://mailund.dk/errata/fdsinr/</guid>
      <description>One big regret I have about this book is that I didn’t implement the pattern matching code from Domain-Specific Languages in R before this book. Pattern matching makes implementing data structures much easier.</description>
