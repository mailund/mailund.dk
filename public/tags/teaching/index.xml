      <description>In the second lesson I teach in our Computational Thinking in Bioinformatics I cover algorithmic complexity. It is chapter four in my (draft) book on the topic: Introduction to Computational Thinking.
I have put exercises and my answers to them on GitHub. I still haven’t figured out the best way to give them to the students yet, but the can always read them on GitHub and download the source files where needed.
Anyway, I know I always make mistakes both in phrasing the exercises and in answering them—not always substantial errors, but still. So if you have some time left and if you are interested in the topic, I would love to hear if there any obvious mistakes.</description>

      <description>I’m teaching four weeks of a class called Computational Thinking in Bioinformatics this year (the other weeks are taught by colleagues).
It is this class that got me started on my book on the topic: Introduction to Computational Thinking. I have finished the chapters I need for the class—chapters three, four, five, seven and nine—but there is still a looong way to go before the book is done.
Anyway, I am not writing on the book these days, but make slides for the lectures. That takes surprisingly long time. I have grown used to having slides to pick and choose from for any lecture, but I am starting from scratch here.</description>
