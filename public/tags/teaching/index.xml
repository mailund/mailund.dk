      <description>I think I’m done with the exercises for chapter 4 of Introduction to Computational Thinking. Which is good, because I need to put them on Blackboard for my students this week.</description>

      <description>I have cleaned up the exercises for chapter three of Introduction to Computational Thinking. I’m still not exactly sure how best to provide them to my students, or if I can figure out some way to automatically test answers so they can be more interactive, but I have listed them below.</description>
