      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on an algorithm for suffix array construction today. It&amp;rsquo;s called prefix doubling, but I don&amp;rsquo;t have a link, sorry. I think it comes from this paper but I don&amp;rsquo;t have access to it at home.</description>

      <title>CPS and Iterators in C</title>

      <description>Today, I want to talk about continuation-passing-style (CSP). This is a general approach you can use to translate recursions into tail-calls.
What&amp;rsquo;s tail-calls, I (imagine hearing) you ask?
A tail-call is when a function calls another function as the last thing it does.</description>

      <title>C Slices</title>

      <description>About those slices I mentioned yesterday, here&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s that about.
I&amp;rsquo;m working on some string algorithms and more straightforward C implementations than those I put in my book.
I implemented all the algorithms and data structures I use in my string algorithm class in Python and Go in the spring,^[I&amp;rsquo;m toying with the idea of writing string algorithms books for those languages, but I have a long list of writing obligations, so I don&amp;rsquo;t know if that will ever happen.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a small C library for Python- or Go-like slices the last couple of weeks. Essentially arrays, but where I can index from the end using negative numbers (like in Python) and where I can extract a sub-slice, x[i:j], in constant time (like in Go; I implement them the same way as Go does).</description>

      <description>The other day I was reminded of an exercises we got first or second year when I studied computer science. It is a cool little trick, that I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen outside of that exercise, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share it.</description>

      <description>I am supervising some projects this spring, on algorithms for read-mapping. It&amp;rsquo;s different projects that all involve implementing a working, but primitive, read mapper.
There is nothing new there, I have a class every year where we do that, but now it is individual projects.</description>

      <title>Book update: Pointers in C and and Computational Thinking</title>

      <description>So, my C pointers book apparently has a cover now. Before you complain, I don&amp;rsquo;t write the titles (although I don&amp;rsquo;t disagree with the title for this book), nor the subtitles (where I do for this one).</description>

      <description>Another day, another post with solutions to 2020 Advent of Code. I am slowly catching up with the actual puzzles, and I will probably get there soon. After that, there will probably be one day per post, except that I expect that the 24th and 25th will be something I leave for after Christmas.</description>

      <description>Ok, now that today’s puzzles are solved, I can go back and look at solutions to the previous days. Today, I will show you my solutions for days six through eight.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m writing the chapter on function pointers in my C pointers book, and I want a nice example of how you can use them to implement rudimentary object-oriented programming with dynamic dispatch.</description>

      <description>I was playing with reference counting garbage collection last week, for something I want to add to my C pointers book. That chapter is still far in the future, and moving further into the future as the book seems to grow in front of me, but one day I will get to it.</description>

      <description>I forgot to post about it when The Joys of Hashing came out, but it is never too late to blow my own horn. It is out and you should get it.</description>

      <description>Now that I am almost done with The Joys of Hashing, I am looking at the material I made last year for our Genome-scale Algorithms class. I implemented a toy read mapper as an example for the final project.</description>
