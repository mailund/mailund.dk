      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on an algorithm for suffix array construction today. It&amp;rsquo;s called prefix doubling, but I don&amp;rsquo;t have a link, sorry. I think it comes from this paper but I don&amp;rsquo;t have access to it at home.</description>

      <description>I am supervising some projects this spring, on algorithms for read-mapping. It&amp;rsquo;s different projects that all involve implementing a working, but primitive, read mapper.
There is nothing new there, I have a class every year where we do that, but now it is individual projects.</description>

      <description>I wanted to get back to yesterday’s puzzle, and I have a little time before I need to run off…
Yes, I was fed up with manual parsing of strings so decided to do it using the re module for once.</description>

      <description>On the last day of Christmas AoC gave to me an encryption problem, that is really a modular arithmetic problem.
If you decode the description—that is more cryptic than the mathematics—you find that we need to find secret keys by solving equations</description>

      <description>Unexpectedly, I was allowed to play today—it is Christmas, after all—as long as I didn’t spend too much time at the computer. So I hurried up and solved today’s and yesterday’s puzzles quickly.</description>

      <description>This will be the last post I write before New Year. We have vacation in the house from tomorrow, and I won’t be hacking when I am supposed to be social—I am told.</description>

      <description>Day 20: Jurassic Jigsaw Day 20 we get tiles for a puzzle, and we have to work out the puzzle from them. The tiles can be rotated or flipped, but we can connect them by identifying how edges match.</description>

      <description>I will make this one quick, because I don’t have much time. Today, we are given some rules for what strings should look like, and we are to validate a set of strings and count how many are valid.</description>

      <description>Well, today, my blogging catches up with my Advent of Code hacking. Just in time to fall behind again in the weekend. If that happens, I should be able to write up my weekend solutions on Monday.</description>

      <description>My posts are almost catching up to Advent of Code, which probably means that I will fall behind in the weekend. Quite likely, actually. I probably have time for solving the puzzles, but not writing about them.</description>

      <description>I don’t have a lot of time today, so I will only describe the solutions for two days. I promise that I will catch up to the day the puzzles are released, but it probably won’t be until after the weekend…</description>

      <description>Another day, another post with solutions to 2020 Advent of Code. I am slowly catching up with the actual puzzles, and I will probably get there soon. After that, there will probably be one day per post, except that I expect that the 24th and 25th will be something I leave for after Christmas.</description>

      <description>Ok, now that today’s puzzles are solved, I can go back and look at solutions to the previous days. Today, I will show you my solutions for days six through eight.</description>

      <description>While I wait for comments on the last chapters of my upcoming C-pointers book, I have some time on my hands. And since corona keeps me at home, I have to find something to keep me entertained.</description>

      <description>I was a little disappointed about this. I had hoped it would give a good overview of Scipy, but instead, it is a bunch of examples that use it. It is not that the examples aren&amp;rsquo;t interesting.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m working on a preprocessor for Markdown documents. I write all my books in Markdown, so this is something I have wanted to do for a while, to scratch a few itches I have.</description>

      <description>I just finished reading Fluent Python. This is a really nice book on Python programming. It is not an introduction to Python programming, and it is not about specific packages, such as SciPy or Scikit-learn.</description>
