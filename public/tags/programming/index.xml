      <description>I have written various software over the years. You can get a list of most of it at GitHub. Below is a list of software I have worked on recently (and I promise to still be maintaining).</description>

      <description>Ok, now that today’s puzzles are solved, I can go back and look at solutions to the previous days. Today, I will show you my solutions for days six through eight.</description>

      <description>While I wait for comments on the last chapters of my upcoming C-pointers book, I have some time on my hands. And since corona keeps me at home, I have to find something to keep me entertained.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m writing the chapter on function pointers in my C pointers book, and I want a nice example of how you can use them to implement rudimentary object-oriented programming with dynamic dispatch.</description>

      <description>I was playing with reference counting garbage collection last week, for something I want to add to my C pointers book. That chapter is still far in the future, and moving further into the future as the book seems to grow in front of me, but one day I will get to it.</description>

      <description>Now that I am almost done with The Joys of Hashing, I am looking at the material I made last year for our Genome-scale Algorithms class. I implemented a toy read mapper as an example for the final project.</description>

      <title>Lazy queues</title>

      <description>The purpose of the lazy lists I implemented in my previous post was to build lazy queues. Lazy lists give you constant time concatenation, which can be useful in itself, but I needed it to implement persistent functional queues.</description>

      <description>I wanted to write about lazy lists and lazy queues today, but I spent most of the day struggling with getting lazy evaluation to work. Finally, I convinced myself that something was broken in R, and I was justified in thinking that; upgrading to the most recent version resolved the issue.</description>

      <description>I wanted to write something about function parameters, how these are passed as so-called &amp;ldquo;promises&amp;rdquo;, how these have associated scopes (and the consequences of that), and how they give us lazy evaluation.</description>

      <description>In my two previous posts on non-standard evaluation, Scoping rules and NSE and Overscoping and eval, I explained:
 How R finds the bindings of variables by looking through chains of environments.</description>

      <description>In my previous post I used the lm function for an example of scope rules, but I left a few details out. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to muddy the example with too many details, so I chose to lie a little.</description>

      <description>Earlier this week, I wrote some tweets about how you have to be careful about scopes when you do &amp;ldquo;non-standard evaluation&amp;rdquo;. I cover this in both Metaprogramming in R and Domain-Specific Languages in R, but this tweet</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m working on a preprocessor for Markdown documents. I write all my books in Markdown, so this is something I have wanted to do for a while, to scratch a few itches I have.</description>
