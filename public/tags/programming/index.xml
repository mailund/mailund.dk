      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m working on a preprocessor for Markdown documents. I write all my books in Markdown, so this is something I have wanted to do for a while, to scratch a few itches I have.
I write my books in Markdown and then I process them using Pandoc. If you are not familiar with that setup, then I have written a short book on the topic: The Beginner&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Markdown and Pandoc.
For that book, because it is very short, I just have a single Markdown document containing the entire book, but usually, I have one file per chapter. Pandoc doesn&amp;rsquo;t handle that, but you can cat the files before you convert the Markdown source to PDF or ePUB documents.</description>

      <description>I have written various software over the years. You can get a list of most of it at GitHub. Below is a list of software I have worked on recently (and I promise to still be maintaining). I will do my best to handle issues with older software, but some of it is simply too old for me to keep track of.
premarkdown The premarkdown project is a preprocessor for my Markdown manuscripts. It contains code for analysing and processing Markdown files and producing one or more documents from them.
There is a command-line tool, premd, that does the processing.</description>
