      <description>So, my C pointers book apparently has a cover now. Before you complain, I don&amp;rsquo;t write the titles (although I don&amp;rsquo;t disagree with the title for this book), nor the subtitles (where I do for this one).</description>

      <description>Exercises Missing element You are given a sorted array, A. It contains n - 1 of the numbers from 1 to n. You should find the missing number.
You can use the property that for all numbers i less than the missing number you have A[i] == i, while for all i larger than the missing number you have A[i] == i - 1.</description>

      <description>I don’t really have a lot of exercises for the chapter on recursion. I had planned to combine recursion with divide-and-conquer, but now the two topics are split over two weeks.</description>

      <description>There is not a whole lot to say about recursion as such, but I&amp;rsquo;ve made a few slides. Half of it is just about how function calls work.

      <description>I’m on a roll today! Here are the exercises for chapter 5 of Introduction to Computational Thinking.
Let me know if you spot any errors; I am known to make some from time to time.</description>

      <description>I think I’m done with the exercises for chapter 4 of Introduction to Computational Thinking. Which is good, because I need to put them on Blackboard for my students this week.</description>

      <description>I just finished make slides for chapter 5 of Introduction to Computational Thinking that covers search and sorting algorithms.
The slides cover linear and binary search, insertion, selection and bubble sort, as well as bucket and radix sort.</description>

      <description>I played around a little with my slides for chapter three of Introduction to Computational Thinking and made slides for chapter four.
It takes surprisingly long to make these; I had expected to be done with the five chapters I use in my class this year a few weeks ago but I still have three chapters to go.</description>

      <description>I have cleaned up the exercises for chapter three of Introduction to Computational Thinking. I’m still not exactly sure how best to provide them to my students, or if I can figure out some way to automatically test answers so they can be more interactive, but I have listed them below.</description>

      <description>In the second lesson that I teach in our Computational Thinking in Bioinformatics I cover algorithmic complexity. It is chapter four in my (draft) book on the topic: Introduction to Computational Thinking.</description>

      <description>I’m teaching four weeks of a class called Computational Thinking in Bioinformatics this year (the other weeks are taught by colleagues).
It is this class that got me started on my book on the topic: Introduction to Computational Thinking.</description>
