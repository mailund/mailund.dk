      <description>This will be the last post I write before New Year. We have vacation in the house from tomorrow, and I won’t be hacking when I am supposed to be social—I am told.</description>

      <description>Day 20: Jurassic Jigsaw Day 20 we get tiles for a puzzle, and we have to work out the puzzle from them. The tiles can be rotated or flipped, but we can connect them by identifying how edges match.</description>

      <description>I will make this one quick, because I don’t have much time. Today, we are given some rules for what strings should look like, and we are to validate a set of strings and count how many are valid.</description>

      <description>Well, today, my blogging catches up with my Advent of Code hacking. Just in time to fall behind again in the weekend. If that happens, I should be able to write up my weekend solutions on Monday.</description>

      <description>My posts are almost catching up to Advent of Code, which probably means that I will fall behind in the weekend. Quite likely, actually. I probably have time for solving the puzzles, but not writing about them.</description>

      <description>I don’t have a lot of time today, so I will only describe the solutions for two days. I promise that I will catch up to the day the puzzles are released, but it probably won’t be until after the weekend…</description>

      <description>Another day, another post with solutions to 2020 Advent of Code. I am slowly catching up with the actual puzzles, and I will probably get there soon. After that, there will probably be one day per post, except that I expect that the 24th and 25th will be something I leave for after Christmas.</description>

      <description>Ok, now that today’s puzzles are solved, I can go back and look at solutions to the previous days. Today, I will show you my solutions for days six through eight.</description>

      <description>While I wait for comments on the last chapters of my upcoming C-pointers book, I have some time on my hands. And since corona keeps me at home, I have to find something to keep me entertained.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m writing the chapter on function pointers in my C pointers book, and I want a nice example of how you can use them to implement rudimentary object-oriented programming with dynamic dispatch.</description>

      <description>I was playing with reference counting garbage collection last week, for something I want to add to my C pointers book. That chapter is still far in the future, and moving further into the future as the book seems to grow in front of me, but one day I will get to it.</description>

      <description>Now that I am almost done with The Joys of Hashing, I am looking at the material I made last year for our Genome-scale Algorithms class. I implemented a toy read mapper as an example for the final project.</description>
