    <p>This is an attempt at <a href="https://mailund.dk/posts/red-ridinghood/">another of Neil Gaiman&rsquo;s exercises</a>: write about a fairy tale character in a therapy session.</p>
<p>It is not particularly exciting because I didn&rsquo;t have any story in mind, just the scene, but at least it is an attempt.</p>
<h1 id="trauma-counselling">Trauma Counselling</h1>
<p>Ah, there you are Mrs. Hertzel. Come on in. Do sit down!</p>
<p>Comfortable? Good.</p>
<p>Do you still have difficulty sleeping?</p>
<p>I’m sorry to hear that. Nightmares?</p>
<p>Yes, that is perfectly normal. Are the sleeping pills working?</p>
<p>Sorry to hear that. And the pain?</p>
<p>I’m sorry…</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m told the burn scars are healing well. You should be out of the bandages in a few weeks.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that? Yes. Yes, I understand. No, that is my understanding as well. The scaring will be permanent I&rsquo;m afraid.</p>
<p>How does that make you feel?</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>No, that is understandable. A natural reaction to your trauma.</p>
<p>That brings me to something I would like to talk about this session. You told me last time that you have developed a fear of children.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, given the circumstances that is a natural reaction. Certainly.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>However, a healthier approach would be to work through the anxiety… ah, yes, we can call it fear if you prefer… and try to process it before it becomes a crippling phobia.</p>
<p>Well, after all, you cannot avoid children for the rest of your life. They are bound to wander by. You live in a gingerbread house, after all.</p>
<p>True, high fences might help, yes, as perhaps moving to a non-gingerbread house…</p>
<p>No, no, of course you shouldn’t be forced to move because you were attacked in your own house. I am not saying that. But fencing yourself in, I believe, is not conductive to your mental health.</p>
<p>I understand. However, most research shows that we do not reduce fear by hiding from it. On the contrary, many studies show that avoidance can aggravate phobia.</p>
<p>Well, yes, a “phobia” is an irrational fear, and one could argue that it is not irrational to fear children after a vicious attack, as you have been the vicim of…</p>
<p>Yes, Mrs Hertzel, I hear what you are saying… but you must agree that most children do not, in fact, commit home invasions with murderous intent.</p>
<p>If I may ask, how old are you, Mrs. Hertzel?</p>
<p>Yes, and how long have you lived in your current cottage?</p>
<p>Ok, and for how long has that been a gingerbread house?</p>
<p>For as long as you have lived there, yes…</p>
<p>In the 42 years you have lived in a gingerbread house—which, I think you will agree, will hold some attraction to young children—how many children have entered your property uninvited?</p>
<p>Hundreds, yes… and until this pair, how many have attacked you?</p>
<p>None! My point exactly.</p>
<p>No, that does not mean that children are harmless, clearly not all things considered, but… yes, yes, I understand…, however, to return to normal life—as much as you can, yes—I will recommend that we work on your fear.</p>
<p>Well, cognitive behavioural therapy and exposure therapy have proven to be effective in dealing with trauma and PTSD.</p>
<p>No, I am not suggesting that we expose you to children, at least not right away… for this session, and at least a few more, I am suggesting that we walk through the events, and analyse how you felt, and try to process it.</p>
<p>I am certainly not pretending that I can imagine how it must have felt. I am hoping that you can tell me…</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>Now, I want you to think back to when you first saw Hansel and Gretchen sneaking up to your house…</p>
