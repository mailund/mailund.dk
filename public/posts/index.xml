      <title>Premarkdown Plugins</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m working on a preprocessor for Markdown documents. I write all my books in Markdown, so this is something I have wanted to do for a while, to scratch a few itches I have.
I write my books in Markdown and then I process them using Pandoc. If you are not familiar with that setup, then I have written a short book on the topic: The Beginner&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Markdown and Pandoc.
For that book, because it is very short, I just have a single Markdown document containing the entire book, but usually, I have one file per chapter. Pandoc doesn&amp;rsquo;t handle that, but you can cat the files before you convert the Markdown source to PDF or ePUB documents.</description>

      <title>Fluent Python</title>

      <description>I just finished reading Fluent Python. It is a really nice book on Python programming. It is not an introduction to Python programming, and it is not about specific packages, such as SciPy or Scikit-learn. Rather, it it covers Python topics you might use in day-to-day programming and explains how you would write code in the most Pythonic way.
Well, it covers mostly stuff you would use in everyday programming. It also covers co-routines and meta-programming; topics I do not expect you use every day. From time to time, yes, but not every day. If you find that you need it, though, the coverage in Fluent Python is excellent.</description>

      <title>New Books Page</title>

      <description>I have set up a page for the books I have written. Nothing fancy there, it is just a list together with the cover text, but it does collect all my books on one single page.
I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of putting one sample chapter per book here. I need to check with my Apress contracts, but I believe I can do this as long as it is less than 10%.</description>

      <title>New Blog</title>

      <description>Ok, so, I have had a lot of problems with keeping Wordpress and various plugins up to date on my old mailund.dk blog. Considering that I don&amp;rsquo;t write a whole lot of posts there, I decided that it simply wasn&amp;rsquo;t worth the effort.
On top of that, the account I had on Aarhus University&amp;rsquo;s computers, where I could ssh into a file server and put pages in public_html, will soon be removed. They are simply phasing out those computers, because few really use them any more, and while I could keep ssh access to a virtual account, I don&amp;rsquo;t think it is worth the bother to do this just to keep a homepage.</description>
