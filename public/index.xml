      <description>I just finished reading Fluent Python. It is a really nice book on Python programming. It is not an introduction to Python programming, and it is not about specific packages, such as SciPy or Scikit-learn.</description>

      <description>I have set up a page for the books I have written. Nothing fancy there, it is just a list together with the cover text, but it does collect all my books on one single page.</description>

      <description>Ok, so, I have had a lot of problems with keeping Wordpress and various plugins up to date on my old mailund.dk blog. Considering that I don&amp;rsquo;t write a whole lot of posts there, I decided that it simply wasn&amp;rsquo;t worth the effort.</description>

      <description>Hi there,
This is my personal blog and shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be confused with my word-webpages. I speak only for myself here, even when I write about work-related things.
I don&amp;rsquo;t write a lot here so it is more a web-page than a blog, but I do occasionally say something about what I am working on.</description>

This book starts with simple first attempts devoid of collision resolution strategies, and moves through improvements and extensions illustrating different design ideas and approaches, followed by experiments to validate the choices.</description>
