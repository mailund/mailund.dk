      <description>I just finished reading Fluent Python. This is a really nice book on Python programming. It is not an introduction to Python programming, and it is not about specific packages, such as SciPy or Scikit-learn.</description>

      <description>I have set up a page for the books I have written. Nothing fancy there, it is just a list together with the cover text, but it does collect all my books on one single page.</description>
