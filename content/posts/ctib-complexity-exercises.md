In the second lesson I teach in our [Computational Thinking in Bioinformatics](https://kursuskatalog.au.dk/da/course/82773/Computational-Thinking-in-Bioinformatics) I cover algorithmic complexity. It is chapter four in my (draft) book on the topic: [*Introduction to Computational Thinking*](https://leanpub.com/comp-thinking).

I have put exercises and my answers to them on [GitHub](https://github.com/mailund/computational-thinking-exercises/blob/master/Algorithmic_complexity/README.md). I still haven’t figured out the best way to give them to the students yet, but the can always read them on GitHub and download the source files where needed.

Anyway, I know I always make mistakes both in phrasing the exercises and in answering them—not always substantial errors, but still. So if you have some time left and if you are interested in the topic, I would love to hear if there any obvious mistakes.
