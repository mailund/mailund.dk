I just finished make slides for chapter 5 of [*Introduction to Computational Thinking*](https://leanpub.com/comp-thinking) that covers search and sorting algorithms.

The slides cover linear and binary search, insertion, selection and bubble sort, as well as bucket and radix sort. The chapter covers a little bit more, including how numbers are represented on a computer, and the consequences of this for bucket and radix sort.

You can get the slides [here](https://github.com/mailund/compthink/tree/master/slides/Chapter%205%20-Searching%20and%20Sorting).
