In the weekend I finished [*The Power of Habit*](https://amzn.to/2xO0QHW).

This is a very interesting book. Duhigg writes about how we are run by habit to a degree I had not imagined. How we react to triggers where we have learned, unconsciously, to expect some rewards, and how our brains turn out and runs on routine when that happens. How advertisement exploits this, how sports-teams and companies  can hook into the habit loop for good or for evil.

I strongly recommend the book.
