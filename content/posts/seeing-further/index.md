I also finished [*Seeing Further: The Story of Science, Discovery, and the Genius of the Royal Society*](https://amzn.to/2xPc4f4) yesterday. I found this a mixed back. When I bought it I thought it was a Bill Bryson book—I like those—but if I had checked the description just a little bit I would have seen that it is only edited by Bryson.

The book contains a bunch of chapters, each with different authors. They are all somewhat related to the Royal Society; some involves the history of the Society and others just touch about it in passing.

Some of the chapters are *very* good, others are boring. It is worth a read, but not a book you would return to for a second read.
