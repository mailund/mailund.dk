I have set up a page for the [books I have written](https://mailund.dk/books/). Nothing fancy there, it is just a list together with the cover text, but it does collect all my books on one single page.

I'm thinking of putting one sample chapter per book here. I need to check with my Apress contracts, but I believe I can do this as long as it is less than 10%.
