I played around a little with my slides for chapter three of [*Introduction to Computational Thinking*](https://leanpub.com/comp-thinking) and made slides for chapter four.

It takes surprisingly long to make these; I had expected to be done with the five chapters I use in my class this year a few weeks ago but I still have three chapters to go. I won’t run out of time—I have plenty of time to make slides between the first and last lecture—but it is eating into time I really should be using on [*The Joys of Hashing*](https://amzn.to/2pngZQ0) where a deadline is coming up.

Anyway, here are the slides—let me know if you spot any obvious errors so I can fix them before my lectures.
