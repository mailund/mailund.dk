To my utter shock, it turns out that I am not perfect. There are mistakes in my books!

A couple of readers made me aware of a typo in [**Functional Programming in R**]({{< ref "/errata/FPinR" >}}). It is just a typo, but I can easily see why it can confuse readers.

Much much worse is an error in [**Functional Data-Structures in R**]({{< ref "/errata/FDSinR" >}}). An entire section is utter rubbish. Please donâ€™t read the section on dequeus. The errata has a correct implementation and [this post](https://mailund.github.io/r-programmer-blog/2018/10/01/lists-and-functional-queues/) has a much better explanation than the book.

If you find errors in my books, then *please* let me know so I can update the errata lists and fix them if there are more editions.
