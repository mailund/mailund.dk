Build working implementations of hash tables, written in the C programming language. This book starts with simple first attempts devoid of collision resolution strategies, and moves through improvements and extensions illustrating different design ideas and approaches, followed by experiments to validate the choices. 

Hash tables, when implemented and used appropriately, are exceptionally efficient data structures for representing sets and lookup tables, providing low overhead, constant time, insertion, deletion, and lookup operations. 

The Joys of Hashing walks you through the implementation of efficient hash tables and the pros and cons of different design choices when building tables. The source code used in the book is available on GitHub for your re-use and experiments.

### What You Will Learn
* Master the basic ideas behind hash tables
* Carry out collision resolution, including strategies for handling collisions and their consequences for performance
* Resize or grow and shrink tables as needed
* Store values by handling when values must be stored with keys to make general sets and maps

Get an introduction to functional data structures using R and write more effective code and gain performance for your programs. This book teaches you workarounds because data in functional languages is not mutable: for example you’ll learn how to change variable-value bindings by modifying environments, which can be exploited to emulate pointers and implement traditional data structures. You’ll also see how, by abandoning traditional data structures, you can manipulate structures by building new versions rather than modifying them. You’ll discover how these so-called functional data structures are different from the traditional data structures you might know, but are worth understanding to do serious algorithmic programming in a functional language such as R.

By the end of Functional Data Structures in R, you’ll understand the choices to make in order to most effectively work with data structures when you cannot modify the data itself. These techniques are especially applicable for algorithmic development important in big data, finance, and other data science applications.

### What You'll Learn

* Carry out algorithmic programming in R 
* Use abstract data structures 
* Work with both immutable and persistent data 
* Emulate pointers and implement traditional data structures in R
* Build new versions of traditional data structures that are known

### Who This Book Is For

Experienced or advanced programmers with at least a comfort level with R. Some experience with data structures recommended.

Learn how to manipulate functions and expressions to modify how the R language interprets itself. This book is an introduction to metaprogramming in the R language, so you will write programs to manipulate other programs. Metaprogramming in R shows you how to treat code as data that you can generate, analyze, or modify. 

R is a very high-level language where all operations are functions and all functions are data that can be manipulated. This book shows you how to leverage R's natural flexibility in how function calls and expressions are evaluated, to create small domain-specific languages to extend R within the R language itself. 

### What You'll Learn
* Find out about the anatomy of a function in R 
* Look inside a function call
* Work with R expressions and environments
* Manipulate expressions in R
* Use substitutions 

### Who This Book Is For

Those with at least some experience with R and certainly for those with experience in other programming languages.

    </iframe>

Learn how to write object-oriented programs in R and how to construct classes and class hierarchies in the three object-oriented systems available in R. This book gives an introduction to object-oriented programming in the R programming language and shows you how to use and apply R in an object-oriented manner. You will then be able to use this powerful programming style in your own statistical programming projects to write flexible and extendable software.

After reading Advanced Object-Oriented Programming in R, you'll come away with a practical project that you can reuse in your own analytics coding endeavors. You’ll then be able to visualize your data as objects that have state and then manipulate those objects with polymorphic or generic methods. Your projects will benefit from the high degree of flexibility provided by polymorphism, where the choice of concrete method to execute depends on the type of data being manipulated. 

### What You'll Learn
* Define and use classes and generic functions using R 
* Work with the R class hierarchies
* Benefit from implementation reuse
* Handle operator overloading
* Apply the S4 and R6 classes 

### Who This Book Is For

Experienced programmers and for those with at least some prior experience with R programming language.

## Functional Programming in R

<iframe style="width:120px;height:240px;float:left;margin-right:10px" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?ServiceVersion=20070822&OneJS=1&Operation=GetAdHtml&MarketPlace=US&source=ac&ref=qf_sp_asin_til&ad_type=product_link&tracking_id=mailund07-20&marketplace=amazon&region=US&placement=148422745X&asins=148422745X&linkId=496eb72cea7bab56afd0ce50c2f7cc80&show_border=true&link_opens_in_new_window=false&price_color=333333&title_color=0066c0&bg_color=ffffff">

Master functions and discover how to write functional programs in R. In this concise book, you'll make your functions pure by avoiding side-effects; you’ll write functions that manipulate other functions, and you’ll construct complex functions using simpler functions as building blocks.

In Functional Programming in R, you’ll see how we can replace loops, which can have side-effects, with recursive functions that can more easily avoid them. In addition, the book covers why you shouldn't use recursion when loops are more efficient and how you can get the best of both worlds.

Functional programming is a style of programming, like object-oriented programming, but one that focuses on data transformations and calculations rather than objects and state. Where in object-oriented programming you model your programs by describing which states an object can be in and how methods will reveal or modify that state, in functional programming you model programs by describing how functions translate input data to output data. Functions themselves are considered to be data you can manipulate and much of the strength of functional programming comes from manipulating functions; that is, building more complex functions by combining simpler functions.

### What You'll Learn

* Write functions in R including infix operators and replacement functions 
* Create higher order functions
* Pass functions to other functions and start using functions as data you can manipulate
* Use Filer, Map and Reduce functions to express the intent behind code clearly and safely
* Build new functions from existing functions without necessarily writing any new functions, using point-free programming
* Create functions that carry data along with them

### Who This Book Is For

Those with at least some experience with programming in R.

Markdown is a markup language; the name is a pun. Markup languages are used to annotate text formatting information, typically with a stronger focus on semantic information than direct formatting as you would do with WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) formatting. With markup languages, you might annotate your text with information about where chapters and sections start, but not how chapter and heading captions should be formatted. Doing this decouples the structure of a text from how it is visualised and makes it easier for you to produce different kinds of output. The same text can easily be formatted as HTML, PDF, or Word documents, with various visual styles, by tools that understand the markup annotations.

Pandoc is a tool for translating between different markup languages, such as LaTeX, HTML, and Markdown. I use it for formatting the books I write. This booklet describes how. I will tell you how to write manuscripts in Markdown and translate them with Pandoc into different output formats. I will not describe all the functionality that Pandoc provides, only how it can be used to write papers and books in Markdown. If that is something you are interested in, The Beginner’s Guide to Markdown and Pandoc will get you started.
